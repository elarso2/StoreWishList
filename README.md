[![MIT Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://mit-license.org/)

## Description

For this project, we were tasked with creating a full-stack application that showcases the skills we have learned thus far in our course. Some of our requirements were to: 
* Use Node.js and Express.js to create RESTful API,
* Use Handlebars for templating, and MySQL and Sequelize for data,
* Write GET and POST routes for data addition and retrieval,
* Include a library or package not previously used in class,
* Use the MVC paradigm to organize our folders,
* Include user authentication and protect sensitive information,
* And deploy a polished UI application on Heroku.

## User Story
